	 Which two statements are true about localizing an application? (Choose two.)

	A. Support for new regional languages does not require recompilation of the code.
	 B. Textual elements (messages and GUI labels) are hard-coded in the code.
	 C. Language and region-specific programs are created using localized data.
	 D. Resource bundle files include data and currency information.
	 E. Language codes use lowercase letters and region codes use uppercase letters

	A. Support for new regional languages does not require recompilation of the code.
	E. Language codes use lowercase letters and region codes use uppercase letters.
	
	Explanation:
	A: True.
	Localization in Java typically uses resource bundles. These are external files (e.g., .properties files) that contain localized text and data. Adding support for a new language requires creating a new resource bundle, not recompiling the code.
	
	E: True.
	The format for language and region codes follows the ISO standards:
	
	Language codes: Lowercase (e.g., en for English, fr for French).
	Region codes: Uppercase (e.g., US for the United States, FR for France).
